Objective: Predicted car prices using linear regression with an RÂ² score of 0.85.
Key Contributions:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data, engineered features (e.g., vehicle age), and converted categorical variables into numerical form using get_dummies.
Model Development: Trained and evaluated a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Web App Deployment:
Built a Flask web application with an intuitive user interface for feature input and price prediction.
Integrated the trained model using pickle for real-time predictions.
Technology Used: Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, HTML/CSS.
Outcome: Delivered an end-to-end solution for real-time car price prediction, combining ML and web development.

# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Web Application  

## Overview  
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts car prices based on user-provided features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and vehicle age. The solution uses **Linear Regression** to deliver predictions with an **RÂ² score of 0.85** and is deployed via a **Flask** web application.  

## Features  
- **Accurate Predictions**: Predict car prices based on historical data with a high RÂ² score.  
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Intuitive form for entering car details and receiving price predictions in real-time.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn  
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML/CSS  
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle  

## How It Works  
1. Users input car details such as mileage, fuel type, and age into the web form.  
2. The Flask backend processes the inputs and sends them to the trained regression model.  
3. The model predicts the car's selling price and displays it to the user in real-time.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add support for advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.  
- Integrate additional features like location or economic trends for more precise predictions.  
- Deploy the application to cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Render for broader accessibility.  

## Acknowledgments  
- Inspired by real-world use cases of predicting car resale values.  
- Utilized the open-source Python ecosystem for end-to-end development.
